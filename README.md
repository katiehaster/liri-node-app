## What it does

*Bands In Town
Want to know when your favorite band is playing? Type into the module: node liri.js concert-this <your band here>, and the module will populate with your favorite band or solo artist's upcoming concert dates, complete with venues and locations.

*Spotify
Type in the title of the song that's been in your head all day, again, in the format node liri.js spotify-this-song <song title>, and the module will answer back with details about said song - who it's by, what album it's attached to, and more.

*Movie Search
I love the film John Wick, but I can't remember what year it was made or who plays the wife... type in node liri.js movie-this <movie title> and the module will answer back with more details than you could ever need about said film, including, of course, the year it was made and the actors.

*Random Feature
Use this "do-what-it-says" feature to have the app read from a text file to display a band, song, or movie.
